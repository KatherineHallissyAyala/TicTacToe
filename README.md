navigate to the files' directory, and run "http-server" in that directory.  The output in terminal will indicate the URL to use to

# Roadmap for future improvements
I worked on this project in a Fullstack Developer certification course.  

I can envision improving the game by adding a visual response to the buttons when there is a winner, such as filling the winning squares with a bright color. I would accomplish this by refactoring the Square component such that the square sets is background color when it belongs to the winning subset of the "win" array. 

The game could also be improved by offering 3 rounds and displaying how many rounds each player has won.  Players could aim for the best two out of three.  I would do this by creating a new state variable object to store player wins.
